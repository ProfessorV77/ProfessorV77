### Welcome to my Info!

I'm a student who mainly uses python, but also has experience in C++, Swift, HTML, CSS and Java Script.

Lately I'm working a lot with the Blender Python API to create some custom simulations and other fun coding visualisations.

Feel free to critize or suggest improvements for my code.
